Throughout the years, I have learned a tremendous amount by reading various
blogs on the internet. These are sites I regularly go to or that pop up in
search results when researching a specific topic. The information I find useful
ranges from low level details to high level wisdom. I believe all these sources
are part of my education and I appreciate the authors very much for it. With
this blog, I hope to share some ideas and insights so that other people may
benefit the way I still do every day.
